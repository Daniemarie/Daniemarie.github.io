### Anime

Anime is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. In Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. However, outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for Japanese animation and refers specifically to animation produced in Japan. Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is referred to as anime-influenced animation.

Genres are different categories of works, based on the subject matter and how it is presented. Just like novels and drama have different genres, anime is no different. Each genre has its own characteristics that make it unique. Some examples of genres in anime are action, comedy, slice of life, drama/tragedy, psychological, history, mecha/military, supernatural/magic, romance and isekai.
